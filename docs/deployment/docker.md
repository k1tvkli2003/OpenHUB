# Docker

## Basic run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k1tvkli2003/OpenHUB.git
cd OpenHUB
docker build -t openhub:local .
docker volume create openhub-data
docker network inspect openhub-net >/dev/null 2>&1 || docker network create openhub-net
docker run -d --name openhub \
  --network openhub-net \
  -p 2455:2455 -p 1455:1455 \
  -v openhub-data:/var/lib/openhub \
  openhub:local
```

OpenHUB 2.0.0 does not publish a GHCR image. These commands intentionally build
the image from the checked-out release. If you push it to your own registry,
replace `openhub:local` with that fully qualified image reference.

Ports:

- `2455` — dashboard + proxy API
- `1455` — OAuth login callback (needed while adding accounts)

The volume holds everything under `/var/lib/openhub/` (database, encryption key, archives) — back it up to preserve your data.

## Switching Wi-Fi or other networks

When a laptop switches from one Wi-Fi network to another—for example, from home Wi-Fi to a phone hotspot—or when a VPN connects or disconnects, existing internet connections may briefly break. Docker can also keep using a DNS server from the previous network. DNS is the service that finds the network address for names such as `chatgpt.com`; if Docker's copy is out of date, openhub may report timeouts while contacting OpenAI even though the host browser works.

openhub retries only when the transport can prove that the request failed before it was sent. Merely seeing no output is not enough: if a request may already have reached OpenAI, openhub returns the network error without resending it, which avoids accidentally starting the same response twice. In either case, it avoids treating a laptop-wide DNS problem as a problem with an individual account. It cannot, however, repair a Docker DNS service that remains pointed at the old network.

For laptops that switch networks frequently:

- **Simplest on Linux, macOS, and Windows:** run `uvx openhub` directly on the host. This avoids Docker's additional DNS layer.
- **Docker Engine on Linux (verified with `systemd-resolved`):** use host networking so the container shares the host resolver path. This survives network switches only when the host exposes a stable resolver address, such as the `127.0.0.53` `systemd-resolved` stub. If the host's `/etc/resolv.conf` points directly to a DNS server supplied by Wi-Fi or other DHCP, that address can still become stale. In that case, configure a stable host resolver, follow the [bridge-listener runbook](https://github.com/k1tvkli2003/OpenHUB/blob/main/openspec/specs/deployment-networking/context.md#diagnostics-and-recovery), or prefer `uvx`. Use the following command instead of the portable Docker command above.
- **Docker Desktop on macOS or Windows:** Docker Desktop 4.34 and later offers opt-in host networking, but containers still run through Docker Desktop's virtual machine and its DNS behavior can vary by version and configuration. This setup has not been verified as a reliable fix for switching networks. Keep Docker Desktop current; if failures persist, prefer the native `uvx` installation.

```bash
docker volume create openhub-data
docker run -d --name openhub \
  --network host \
  -v openhub-data:/var/lib/openhub \
  openhub:local
```

In the verified Docker Engine setup on Linux, host networking does not use `-p`; openhub still listens on ports 2455 and 1455. It also removes Docker's network-namespace isolation. The command is an opt-in path to a stable host resolver, not a DNS fix by itself.

## Docker Compose

For a production-shaped Compose setup (watchtower-friendly tags, external PostgreSQL via env), start from
[`docker-compose.prod.yml`](https://github.com/k1tvkli2003/OpenHUB/blob/main/docker-compose.prod.yml) — it defines
only the `server` service. The optional `postgres` / `postgres-upgrade` profiles live in the root
[`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/k1tvkli2003/OpenHUB/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) (see [Database](../database.md)):

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # required: the compose file references .env.local via env_file — an unedited copy still runs with zero config
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

For PostgreSQL profiles and the Postgres 16 → 18 upgrade runbook, see [Database](../database.md).

## Auth mode examples

**Authelia / trusted header**

```bash
docker run -d --name openhub \
  -p 2455:2455 -p 1455:1455 \
  -e OPENHUB_DASHBOARD_AUTH_MODE=trusted_header \
  -e OPENHUB_DASHBOARD_AUTH_PROXY_HEADER=Remote-User \
  -e OPENHUB_FIREWALL_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true \
  -e OPENHUB_FIREWALL_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS=172.18.0.0/16 \
  -v openhub-data:/var/lib/openhub \
  openhub:local
```

**Hard override / no app-level dashboard auth**

```bash
docker run -d --name openhub \
  -p 2455:2455 -p 1455:1455 \
  -e OPENHUB_DASHBOARD_AUTH_MODE=disabled \
  -v openhub-data:/var/lib/openhub \
  openhub:local
```

For Helm, pass the same values through `extraEnv`. What these modes mean and when to use them is covered in [Authentication](../authentication.md).
